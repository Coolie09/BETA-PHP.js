# BETA-PHP.js

# THIS IS JUST A BETA VERSION OF WHAT IS COMING VERY SOON!

## Warning! ⚠️
This code may contain (unlikely) a few bugs! Please contact me in therefor in the issues section! Thx a lot! <br>
This is just a Beta-Version of many other functions respectively methods to be more precise that'll come soon. Now there are just String-Functions avaiable. <br>
(and not all of them and not every of them is going to work ^^', but that'll change soon :) )
A code editor your choise is necessary to use this script.

## What does this script do?
This is a collection of functions, that don't exist in this way in JavaScript, but in PHP. That's why i've written them in JavaScript. <br>

## How to use this script
There is no universal way to use this script in this case. In fact, these functions are intended to be an aid to programming, since many of them can be very useful and <br> are missing in JavaScript. Logically, therefore, it should have become clear that you have to copy the various functions into the editor to be able to use them. It <br> does not matter which one it is in this case. <br>
